// Handler handles key strokes from the keyboard.  A Handler
// is essentially the text engine for the text editor.  It takes each
// character entered by the user and processes it into text (or commands)
// to provide to the editor.  If you want vidar to feel like vim, this
// is the type of command to implement.
//
// It is the responsibility of the input handler to correctly deal with
// text input fast enough to keep up with a user.  When implementing a
// Handler, it's important to use goroutines to run hooks and make sure
// that slow hooks are not slowing down the Handler or other hooks.
//
// Since the Handler will replace vidar's default Handler, it should
// accept both commands.ChangeHook and commands.ContextChangeHook as
// hooks that can bind to it in order to support hooks that intend to
// bind to vidar's default Handler.
